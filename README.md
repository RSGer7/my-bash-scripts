my bash scripts

-----------------------------

createscript.sh: \n
An easy way to create and set up a bash-script-file. \n
Creates script-file (or exits if file already exists), sets permissions, adds "#!/bin/bash" to first line \n

usage example: \n
createscript.sh mynewscript.sh \n
-> this will create a file with the name "mynewscript.sh", set permissions, and add "#!/bin/bash" to its first line.  \n

-----------------------------

mycc: \n

Usage example: \n
mycc myprogram.c \n
Like gcc but automatically names compiled c-program like its source code file, but without the ".c". \n
E.g.: "mycc myprogram.c" compiles the program and names the compiled executable "myprogram". \n
